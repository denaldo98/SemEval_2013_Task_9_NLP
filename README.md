# SemEval-2013-Task-9
Project realized for the course *Advanced Human Languages Technologies* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya* (Master in *Artificial Intelligence*).

The project consists in solving Task 9 of the *Semeval-2013: International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation* ([link to the paper)](https://aclanthology.org/S13-2056/).

The task concerns the recognition of drugs and extraction of drug-drug interactions that appear in biomedical literature. It is divided in two subtasks:

-   Task 9.1: Recognition and classification of drugs (NERC).
-   Task 9.2: Detection and classification of drug-drug interactions between pairs of drugs (DDI).

The tasks is solved by using 3 different approaches:

 - Rule-based approach
 - Traditional Machine-Learning approach
 - Deep Learning approach
 

## Documentation and Reports

 - [Assignment_1_AHLT](https://github.com/denaldo98/SemEval-2013-Task-9/blob/main/Assignment_1_AHLT.pdf) contains the procedures followed to solve Task 9.1 by using the Rule-based approach and the traditional Machine Learning-based approach. The report provides also the main snippets of Python code, together with the obtained final results.
 - [Assignment_2_AHLT](https://github.com/denaldo98/SemEval-2013-Task-9/blob/main/Assignment_2_AHLT.pdf) contains the procedures followed to solve Task 9.2 by using the Rule-based approach and the traditional Machine Learning-based approach. The report provides also the main snippets of Python code, together with the obtained final results.
- [Assignment_3_AHLT](https://github.com/denaldo98/SemEval-2013-Task-9/blob/main/Assignment_3_AHLT.pdf) contains the procedurec followed to solve  Task 9.1 and Task 9.2 by using the Deep Learning-based approach. The report provides also the main snippets of Python code, together with the obtained final results on both tasks.
